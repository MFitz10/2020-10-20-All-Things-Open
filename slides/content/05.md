# Let's Code

<aside class="notes">

Building:

- REST API
- Compress, store and serve images
- Lots of systems-level requirements
- Key feature: make the python _stateless_ by offloading the database / data manipulation work to Go
- Inspired by a project that a fellow Twitch streamer built: https://nyx.xyz/share
  - Shoutout to @nyxiative
