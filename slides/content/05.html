<h2>Where does go fit into Python?</h2>

- long running tasks that get kicked off by an incoming event (i.e. HTTP request)
- long running background jobs like "sidecars" (i.e. log aggregator)
- "tier 2" backend services like caches, etc...
- places where you are forking your process to get more concurrency
    i.e. the multiprocess module
- when you're using fibers
    goroutines might make sense
- anywhere you hit the Global Interpreter Lock
- anywhere you need to run on >1 core
- you have to ship your app somewhere else (no need to also ship an interpreter)
