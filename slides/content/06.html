<h2>How to fit Go into Py</h2>

- we're not talking about a python/Go FFI interface or anything like that
- not talking about automated transcoding/conversions either
    for example, https://github.com/google/grumpy
- we're talking about writing new code or replacing some python code with Go code
    something like "manual transcoding"


possible things you can do right now, with no code changes:

- sidecars - capture your logs or statistics if you're building a webapp
- backend "layers" - for example a proxy for your database or a proxy in front of your web app
