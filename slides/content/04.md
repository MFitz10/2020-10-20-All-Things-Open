## Patterns from Go

- Less magic, less machinery, fewer `class`es
- Compose rather than extend
- Aim for statelessness

[Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) v. [Zen of Go](https://the-zen-of-go.netlify.app/)

Places that Go can fit into a Python codebase

Both have:

- Good developer tools ([Black](https://github.com/psf/black),  `go fmt`, editors, ...)
- Readable
- Simple concurrency abstractions

Readable:

- Python = less syntax
- Go = fewer keywords

High level concurrency:

- Go is truly parallel, Python is not b/c the GIL

Put expensive tasks into Go, keep elegant tasks in Python

Expensive tasks:

- We're not talking about FFI or transcoding code
- "tier 2" backend services like caches, etc...
- places where you are forking your process to get more concurrency

Elegant code:

- Go is not an elegant language in the eyes of Python
- Use it for its capabilities, not its beauty or elegance
