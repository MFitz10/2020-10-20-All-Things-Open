## Go v. Python

Only some of the strengths of each languages

- 🐿️ Backend {servers, jobs}
- 🐿️ Multi-core
- 🐍 Fast prototyping
- 🐍 Full-stack dev

<aside class="notes">

- WEAKNESS: Go tests make you do a lot more "plumbing" work and lack all the awesome magic that pytest gives you (fixtures, "table driven tests", mocking, etc...)
- It's a static, compiled language, so you get
    - more compile-time safety
    - efficiency at runtime
    - fewer unit tests than a dynamic scripting language
- built-in true multicore concurrency
- very low level control over networking
- strong backward compat. guarantees in the standard lbrary
  - "the Go 1.0 promise"

    but:

    - less flexibility with your variables (they are typed, so you're limited in what you can change a var to)
    - define more things up-front (i.e. data types)
    - more verbose in many cases (you have to type the data type before you create data in many cases)

        mything = {"a": "b"}
        mygothing := map[string]string{"A": "B"}
    
    - less high-level networking support out of the box

    for both languages:

    - garbage collector & runtime, so you don't have ABSOLUTE control over how your program is using its hardware
        Go probably won't help your python program if you need "bare metal" performance
