My slides and code for All Things Open 2020


# Python v. Go Notes

- Black code formatting - closest thing to go fmt
- mypy type checking (there are others too) = closest thing to static type checks that compilers/static languages give you
- **consider showing go test generation**
  - maybe to show how much boilerplate tests can have?
  - maybe to show the tooling is great
  - CODE GENERATION IN GO IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE
- Python has property based testing (https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
