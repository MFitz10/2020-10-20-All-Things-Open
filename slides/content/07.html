<h2>The app</h2>

Ideas:

- REST API for compressing files
    Or full-stack with a UI
    like this UI: https://nyx.xyz/share shoutout to @nyxiative
- doing some kind of indexing

Key feature: make the python _stateless_ by offloading the database / data manipulation work to Go

overall: writing a web app that returns a 201 CREATED - you initiate some work
and it starts it and returns
