<h2>What Go Isn't</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>High level abstractions (although people are trying)</li>
        - not that good for fast prototyping (although better than other languages "in its class")
        - not well suited for general purpose programming language
        - not suited for real-time programs and applications
    </ul>
</p>
