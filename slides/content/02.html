<h2>What Go Is</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Systems programming language</li>
        <li>Suited toward "low level" applications</li>
        like:

        - backend servers
        - building databases/caches
        - highly concurrent, distributed apps
            although "hardcore" apps like highly time/clock sensitive stuff is
            not good for Go b/c GC pauses etc...
        - "cloud native"
        - Great for CLI utils
            good library support
            cross-compile support
            static hermetically sealed binaries
            "small" binaries (depends on the app)


        Some new uses:
        - "small" footprint applications
            Note: not talking about firmware
            sometimes people run this embedded but the community isn't very big yet
            More like small VMs in the cloud, rPi, etc....
        - Suitable for IoT applications
        - full-stack web dev (gobuffalo.io)
    </ul>
